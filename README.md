# DSST
Matlab version of DSST
1. You should cut the video into images(frames)
2.  write the coordinates of the objects in the image of the first frame in gt.txt, namely the point in the upper left corner and the point in the lower right corner
3. You could look at sequences for reference, frames.txt is not needed, and he wrote all the gt.txt in it to make the result more accurate, but this is too troublesome, we only need to write the first frame
4. run the run_tracker.m
